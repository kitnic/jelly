# Light-following Jellyfish Bristlebot

Update: I built one of these and it "works" but it seems to be more afraid of the light rather than following it. The tilt switch circuit does not seem to work and I will have to debug this. 

This is a small light following robot that consists of a simple analog circuit and uses pager vibration motors and toothbrush heads as a form of locomotion. 
This was heavily inspired by [Facelessloser's project](https://facelesstech.wordpress.com/2016/08/15/light-following-bristle-bot/) but adds:

- Jellyfishness (with the help of [svg2mod](https://github.com/mtl/svg2mod))
- Tilt switch so that it will turn on when turned over

You can buy most of the parts through the [kitnic.it page](https://kitnic.it/boards/github.com/monostable/jelly) but you will also need:

- 2 Pager vibration motors
- 1 Tilt switch
- 2 Toothbrush heads
- 2 Cable ties
