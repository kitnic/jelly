# Light-following Jellyfish Bristlebot

*This is not tested yet, give me a minute, geez!*

This is a small light following robot that consists of a simple analog circuit and uses pager vibration motors and toothbrush heads as a form of locomotion. 
This was heavily inspired by [Facelessloser's project](https://facelesstech.wordpress.com/2016/08/15/light-following-bristle-bot/) but adds:

- Jellyfishness (with the help of [svg2mod](https://github.com/mtl/svg2mod))
- Tilt switches so that it will turn on when turned over

You can buy most of the parts through the [kitnic.it page](https://kitnic.it/boards/github.com/monostable/jelly) but you will also need:

- Pager vibration motors
- Tilt switches
- Toothbrush heads
- Cable ties
